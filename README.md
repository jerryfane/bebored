# BeBored

How many of you when you don't know what to do, instantly open Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Snapchat or whatever. It has become almost an instinctive movement of our fingers. We feel a little bored, and in less than a second we find ourselves scrolling through posts on instagrams, to relieve boredom. And in no time at all,  we have an average daily usage of over 2 hours per social, and makes us question what we're doing with our life as a whole. We can try to make some changes to our behaviours, but we can never get away from socials.

What is the solution? Keep getting bored! 
With BeBored this is possible! The first and only application that allows you to get bored while earning, all thanks to the power of blockchain. 

Recent studies have shown how being bored is a fundamental activity that our body performs autonomously to release stress, and recharge the mind. If we never give space to our mind to stop, and not think of anything but thoughts that arise spontaneously, we'll continue to overload not only the mind, but especially the body, of stress. 

Waiting in line, sitting in a coffee shop, stopped at a traffic light, many people do not lose a moment to open social networks, to stave off boredom, but through BeBored, you will have full control of your actions. You can CHOOSE to be bored, to allow your mind to wander. 

Being bored is a natural action we should take, but with the huge amount of easy stimulus we can find nowadays, it is less and less common. Studies have confirmed that boredom can actually makes you more creative, more altruistic, more likely to set goals for your future. 

> "When you're bored your mind wanders. That's only natural. The state of boredom is one where your attention is not focused on anything in particular. Researches have shown this mind wandering is useful for creativity. 

> "In the absence of boredom, one would remain trapped in unfulfilling situations, and miss out on many emotionally, cognitively and socially rewarding experiences. Boredom is both a warning that we're not doing what we want to be doing, and a push that motivates us to switch goals and projects."


Every time you are waiting for something, you have a decision to make which seems like a tiny one. Head over your favorite social media app, or just **BeBored**, and **Experience Only Your Thoughts**.

## How is Blockchain Integrated

**Why do we need a Blockchain? **


BeBored competes for the attention of its users with the largest tech companies in the world, which control the social networks used by billions of people. The problem of these social networks is that they are centrally controlled by a single entity, the tech company that developed it, which is not a non-profit, has only one goal: "Make Profit". 

*How do they make profits?* All the major social networks existing at the moment, manage to earn billions of dollars in revenues selling the attention of their users to the best advertising bidders. This shifts of incentives, is not for the benefit of users, but purely for the benefit of the big tech company. In this sense, users become pure pieces, whose only goal is to stay glued in their favorite social networks, to bring more and more profit to the big tech through advertising. 

By using the blockchain, we are able to align user incentives with our incentives, in a transparent and decentralized manner. We want BeBored to be a decentralised, community owned, project, and the best way to do this is through well thought out decentralised economics. 

Users who make the choice of Being Bored, as opposed to selling off their attention to big tech companies, will become owners of BeBored, with the possibility to earn rewards by experiencing their thoughts.  In this way, BeBored and its users will be able to grow hand in hand, and bring tiny changes that will provide incremental benefits especially in the users' everyday life. 


**How does it work**


1. Get Bored

2. Earn

3. Cash Out

On BeBored, users will be able to complete tasks and challenges that will enable them to earn Boring Bucks. The challenges will be mainly weekly challenges, and to participate you will need to pay a small amount in Boring Bucks. The winners will share the prize pool and will have the opportunity to earn more rewards. 

In addition to the weekly challenges, there will be personal tasks, which if completed will allow users to earn Boring Bucks for free. 

These tasks and challenges will mainly concern the amount of time spent By Being Bored within the application. In order to check for any fraudulent actions, there will be verification selfies in the Boring Sessions, randomly, or like-random. This should limit any users who, in order to earn rewards only, leave the boring sessions active even when they are not actually being bored, and not experiencing their thoughts. In particular, if the system detects fraudulent actions, there may be penalties. 

For example, for more experienced users, when they start a Boring Sessions, they could lock (or put in stake) an amount of Boring Bucks, which once the session is over, could increase the points in some challenges. If the system were to detect fraud, the amount of Boring Bucks put in stake would be burned, and would no longer be usable.
